    <p>My name is Chris Jopa and I'm a junior web developer. I graduated from Illinois State University with a degree in Business Information Systems. I grew up in the Chicagoland area and I enjoy weight lifting and playing poker. I'm currently focusing on learning front-end web development so I'm mainly blogging about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Follow me on Linkedin and Twitter.</p>
