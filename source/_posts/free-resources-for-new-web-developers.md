It’s essential for web developers to stay up to date with the ever evolving web. I’m a new web developer and there is an endless amount of information about web developing, and it can be confusing to know where to start. Here’s my list of free resources for web developers which range from learning the basics to creating your own website.

1. [GitHub](https://github.com/)

  GitHub provides a platform for sharing and collaborating on projects. It’s based on Git, which is a source code management system. GitHub has social features similar to Facebook where you can “follow” users and “star” your favorite projects.

2. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

  Visual Studio Code is an open source code editor that runs on all the major platforms (Windows, Linux, and Mac). It integrates nicely with Git for source control and has many different extensions you can optionally install.

3. [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

  The Mozilla Developer Network provides information about Open Web Technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Web developers depend on MDN as a trusted API for the web. Here are some great links on MDN for web developers:

  * [HTML Developer Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML)
  * [CSS Developer Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS)
  * [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

4. [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)

   Codecademy is an online learning platform that offers free coding classes. The classes are interactive which allow you to practice coding directly on their website. They have a wide variety of classes including JavaScipt, Git, and SQL.

5. Books

  There are some great free books that you can read online about web development. Here are a couple I'm currently reading:

  * [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) - A solid book about programming with JavaScript.
  * [High Performance Browser Networking](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000545/index.html) - A book that dives deep into networking protocols used by web applications.

6. Mailing Lists

  Mailing lists are a great way to stay up to date with web development. Here are three mailing lists that I subscribe to:

  * [Javascript Weekly](http://javascriptweekly.com/)
  * [Web Development Reading List](https://wdrl.info/)
  * [Dev Tips](https://umaar.com/dev-tips/)
